# Insufficient Error Handling in Dart's `http` Package

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code that uses the `http` package for network requests.  The initial code handles some errors but misses crucial ones, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution provides more comprehensive error handling.

## Bug Description

The `fetchData` function uses a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions during API calls. However, it only checks the HTTP status code.  It doesn't account for other potential issues like socket timeouts, connection failures, or certificate validation errors which might cause exceptions within the `http.get` method itself without affecting the response status code.

## Solution

The solution enhances error handling by explicitly identifying and handling more specific exceptions, thereby making the application more robust and resilient.
